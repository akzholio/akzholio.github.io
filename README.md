My name is Akzhol, and I am a Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience, primarily focused on backend development and delivering robust, scalable solutions.

I am currently employed full-time as a Python Developer at [YouGov](today.yougov.com).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading science fiction and techno-thrillers â€” with Michael Crichton being a favorite author. I also spend time exploring Raspberry Pi projects, 3D printing, and expanding my knowledge through data and machine learning courses. I have a strong interest in analyzing and experimenting with datasets that spark my curiosity. My latest interest is [cassette futurism](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cassette_Futurism).
