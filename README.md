## Software ⎡Data⎦ Engineer

Hello there 👋 

My name is *Akzhol* and I am a **software engineer**, aspiring data, ML engineer.

I currently work full-time as a *Python Developer*. 

In my free time I like to read science fiction, techno thrillers (my favorite author is Michael Crichton), 
tinker with my RaspberryPi, print stuff on my 3D printer, attend data/ML related courses, slice and dice datasets of interest.
